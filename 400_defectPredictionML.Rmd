# (PART) Machine Learning in Defect Predictions in Software Engineering Defect Prediction {-}

There are several research question to deal with:

+ Which metrics have the most predictive power?

+ Which machine learning models have the most predictive power?
  There are the Machine Learning models that can be applied in defect prediciton.
  
  + Classification (Which modules are prone to be defective?)
  + Regression (How many errors in a module?). It is a difficult question but it can help to predict the ranking of modules according how error prone they will be.
  
+ How can we evaluate the learned models?
